# Cursor Rules for Rustlings Project

## Error Message Handling

When the user pastes compilation errors, test failures, or other error messages:

1. **DO NOT directly modify the code** unless explicitly asked to do so
2. **DO analyze and explain**:
   - What the error means
   - Why it's occurring
   - What needs to be fixed
   - Where the issue is located
   - How to fix it (conceptually or step-by-step)

## Code Modification Policy

- Only modify code when the user explicitly requests it (e.g., "fix this", "modify the code", "implement this")
- If the user asks "tell me what's wrong" or "explain this error", provide explanations only
- Always respond in Chinese (Simplified) as per user preference

## Rustlings Specific

- These are learning exercises - explanations should be educational
- Point out the learning concepts being tested
- Help understand Rust concepts, not just fix errors
